Data-Driven ML Credit Card Fraud Detection
We install the Anaconda IDE to perform Python data science and machine learning on a single machine.
We use the Kaggle Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants. This was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. The files were combined and converted into a standard csv format.
